# Analysis of consumer financial product complaints data, to predict whether consumer will be disputed or not?
This dataset contains complaints registered by financial product consumers. It has various attributes such as financial products, issue description, company, states, consumer disputed, etc. The CFPB does not verify the accuracy of all facts alleged in the complaints, but takes steps to confirm a commercial relationship between the consumer and the identified company exists.
For study I have considered only five attributes Product, Company, States, Issue, Tags and Consumer Disputed. To identify whether consumer will be disputed or not?

## Models used for prediction
I have used classification model to predict whether consumer will be disputed or not?. My study includes implementation of Decision, Regression trees (using rpart and Random Forest packages) and Na√Øve Bayes Classifier. To work with this Dataset , it is divided into training and test data.

## Process
Dataset has total 889556 records and 18 column attributes.
